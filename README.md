# EyeLS: A Novel, Accessible Gaze-Tracking Application to Revolutionize Non-Verbal Communication for Patients with Neurodegenerative Disorders

### Neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by progressive degeneration and loss of function in the nervous system, are the leading cause of physical disability worldwide. In particular, neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) impede patients’ ability to perform voluntary muscle movements such as walking or speaking. Accordingly, researchers have attempted to develop augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mechanisms and speech-generating devices (SGDs) to facilitate communication for individuals with speech or language impairments. However, the advantages of AACs and SGDs fail to overcome their limitations due to the inadequate availability and affordability of these devices. Conversely, gaze-tracking technology offers a promising solution to enhance non-verbal communication, but current models are both variable and imprecise. EyeLS utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while incorporating Visual Studio Code as its integrated development environment (IDE). The application’s webcam gaze-tracking implements a ridge regression model to map multi-dimensional eye feature vectors through click locations as training points. Kalman filtering, a Monte Carlo approach to linear quadratic estimation, processes and refines gaze vectors to maximize EyeLS’s precision. Accuracy was calculated using the Euclidean distance between the model’s predicted gaze estimation and click location. The average prediction error made by the ridge regression model over 1500 data points was x̄ = 88.4 pixels with s = 26.9 pixels, correlating to a mean calibration accuracy of 92.23%. EyeLS is a propitious step forward in overcoming the limitations of modern gaze-tracking technology through its precise calibration algorithms, providing an accurate and accessible means of communication for patients with neurodegenerative disorders.
